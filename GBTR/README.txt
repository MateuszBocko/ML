Gradient Boosted Tree Regression model - created for work purposes (thats the reason why each column has name like 'Column1' etc.)

Technicall steps:

1) Clean the data - remove null values, show only values after 1901 year based on column1, convert longs into date format, split column7&8 and create two new columns
2) Convert categorical columns with OneHotEncoder into vectors
3) Run GBTR model
