T-student & Mann Whitneyu models

I created two simple models to check te p-value between two sets of data: 'K' line and ['C1','C2','C3','C4'] groups.

K is the control line for the master degree thesis about the effect of luteolin in in-vitro cell cultures.
The C's groups are the luteolin concetrations.

The purpose of this test was to determine the effectiveness of luteolin at killing cancer cells in a controlled environment.
